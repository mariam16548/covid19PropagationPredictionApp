that the future outcome of the app will contain more factors, such as the number of 
COVID-19 deaths in the county. Through including more factors, the app will become more 
comprehensive. We also anticipate that we will be able to make the algorithm for 
calculating the risk to be more accurate. We can also end up with an app that will help 
college students make a wide variety of decisions that we don't currently offer. We
can get feedback from others in order to add more relevant features to the app. </h3>
