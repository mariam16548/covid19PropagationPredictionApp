NARRATIVE</strong></h2>

<p class="paragraph">We propose a Shiny web app that will help members of the public answer 
 the following question: "Will your actions today likely propagate 
 COVID-19 to your community?". Our app will answer this question using the population 
 and number of cases in a given county. The target audience for our application
 will be college students who are likely living on campus and socializing with others.
 When faced with only a vague sense of the risk, people can make poor COVID-related 
 choices. In our app, we quantify the risk by combining local data with their social
 plans, which helps people make informed decisions. This is done through software 
 combining epidemiological and population data, modeling behavior (alcohol consumption, 
 mask wear, number of participants) to calculate risk in an easy-to-use interface 
 rendered in vivid display.</p>
 
 
<p></p>
 <p class="paragraph">COVID-19 is a large concern nationally, especially for college 
 students. Colleges across the country have opened their campuses to students this fall, 
 resulting in more opportunities for students to socially gather. At the University of 
 North Carolina at Chapel Hill, partying and other social events were big factors in the 
 increased COVID-19 cases. 
 We wanted to find a way to investigate how alcohol consumption as well as other
 factors can decrease awareness and negatively affect social distancing procedures.
 We came up with a Shiny app, which allows users to create interactive web applications,
 to look into this further. This project applies engineering design to produce 
 solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health and safety,
 as well as social and environmental factors to encourage social distancing measures.
 When the risk is calculated to be “extremely high” and the message of “stay home!”
 appears, the user will be more inclined to listen because of the personalized 
 experience the web app provides.

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Plan of Operation</strong></h3>
<ul>
<strong><strong>Project design</strong></strong>
</ul>
<p class="paragraph">We have a prototype that predicts the likelihood of contagious spread
 through two factors: county population (people per square mile)
 and the number of cases in a given county. We use the latest COVID-19 statistics that are
 obtained in real-time through &nbsp;</span><a 
 href="https://www.knowi.com/coronavirus-dashboards/covid-19-api/">Knowi's public data 
 access API</span></a>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">The app combines empirical data (population, case counts,
 transmission rates) with individual social circumstances (group size, 
 age, alcohol use, mask wear, indoors/outdoors) to predict the risk of COVID-19 spread from a planned social
 activity. We use a variety of models (see "Modeling and Implementation Details" section)
 and we produce a range of risk estimates. From this, users of the app are able to 
 predict the consequences of their actions.</p>

<ul>
<strong>Modeling and Implementation Details</strong>
</ul>
<p class="paragraph">The COVID-19 data is currently only available at the county level. 
In order to make 
 sure that the users are able to use their zip code, we used 
 the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/scpike/us-state-county-zip">U.S. 
 Census data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;to link the zip code to 
 the appropriate county. From there, it made it easier to then find the corresponding 
 statistics. In order to produce an estimate for the risk I used the
 following sources:</p>
<ul>



<ul class="paragraph">
<li>MASK WEAR: According 
to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31142-9/fulltext">this</a>&nbsp;paper, 
wearing a mask lowers an individual's risk of contracting the disease by 65%.&nbsp;</li>

</ul>


<p></p>

<ul class="paragraph">

<li> 
<p>ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION: 
In&nbsp;<a href="https://one.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/research/pub/HS809028/index_.htm">this</a>&nbsp;paper,
 it was found that a .08 BAC resulted in an average of 66% impairment in the form of 
 lowered awareness, which would therefore make it more difficult to maintain social 
 distancing measures. </p>
